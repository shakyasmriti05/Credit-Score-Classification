## Dataset
The dataset contains various attributes about individuals (e.g., age, income, loan amount) and their credit score labels (e.g., *Poor*, *Average*, *Good*, *Excellent*).

### Features
- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Income**: Monthly or annual income.
- **Loan Amount**: Amount of any outstanding or previous loans.
- **Credit History**: Score or record of past credit behavior.
- **Employment Status**: Whether the individual is employed, self-employed, etc.

## Modeling
Various classification algorithms are tested, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

## Evaluation
Models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation is used to enhance performance stability.

## Installation
To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
